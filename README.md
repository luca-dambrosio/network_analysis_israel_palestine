- **Subject of the Research:**  
  The study investigates online polarization in the context of the Israel-Palestine conflict, specifically analyzing user interactions on the r/IsraelPalestine subreddit to understand how significant events influence discourse and community dynamics.

- **Data Used:**  
  The research utilized a dataset comprising 14,039 posts from three subreddits (r/Israel, r/Palestine, and r/IsraelPalestine) collected over ten months (July 2023 to April 2024), along with 599,199 interactions among users within these posts.

- **Methodologies Used:**  
  The methodologies included network analysis to map user interactions, natural language processing (NLP) for classifying political leanings (using a fine-tuned roBERTa model), and community detection through the Louvain algorithm to identify clusters within the discourse.

- **Results Found:**  
  Contrary to expectations, the findings indicated that polarization decreased in the months following the onset of conflict, suggesting that moderated online forums may facilitate dialogue rather than exacerbate divisiveness among opposing factions.
